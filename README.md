# Game "Repeat the sequence" on Android.

## Rules of the game:
- The interface consists of four buttons. When a button is pressed, a short sound is played. Each button has its sound, the sounds are of the same theme (e.g. drums, cats, notesâ€¦)
- At first, the application plays a sequence of sounds with a small delay (e.g 500ms). Then, a user must repeat this sequence by successively pressing the desired buttons
- The game is played by levels. With each level, one more sound is added to the playback sequence (previous elements of this sequence are the same). The sequence starts with one sound.


## Mode 1. A basic game
- On application start, the main screen with buttons is opened. Game starting after press button "start"
- When an app is playing a sound or a user pushes the button, this button is highlighted
- The buttons are placed into 2 lines (2 x 2)
- There is a level counter on the screen.
- An app saves a record number of levels
- The first incorrectly pressed button causes a game loss. A dialog is with the resulting number of levels, a game record, and a "Restart" button.
